# DHFilter - Dark.Filter - Project by ADevelopment and DarkHumility
PD2 All-Purpose Early, Mid, and Late Game Filter Udpated for Season 11
Focuses on the Latest Item Tiering based on items' potential trade value with or without good slams + Map Tiering/Immunities + Highlights Jewels, Charms, and Other Items for GG Stats. Shows all Crafting/Socket Bases you'll ever need! Standard Lvl 1 Filter is Low Overall Strictness! Filters out the garbage though! Levels 2 and 3 remove clutter that can make it difficult to pick items in Uber Ancients/Mendeln Event/Very Dense Maps.
